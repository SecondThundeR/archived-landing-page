# SecondThundeR's Landing Page (Project Aether)

[![CodeFactor](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/secondthunder/secondthunder.github.io/badge)](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/secondthunder/secondthunder.github.io) [![License: CC0-1.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-CC0%201.0-lightgrey.svg)](https://github.com/SecondThundeR/secondthunder.github.io/blob/master/LICENSE)

This repository is used to store and host the landing page *(Nothing more, for now)*

This page is fully optimized for computers. Mobile devices have been superficially tested and there may be inconsistencies on different devices *(Perhaps someday I will rewrite this on some framework to work correctly on mobile devices)*
